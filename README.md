# CSI-Assignment 6  
# 🛍️ Product REST API with JWT Authentication

A clean and modular RESTful API built with **Node.js + Express** to manage a collection of products with full CRUD functionality. This version implements **JWT-based authentication** for secure access to the API.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **JWT Authentication**: Secure endpoints with token-based authentication  
- ✅ **RESTful API**: CRUD operations for managing products  
- ✅ **Input validation** using **Joi**  
- ✅ **Custom middleware** for logging and error handling  
- ✅ **In-memory data structure** (no DB required for demo purposes)  
- ✅ **Tested with Postman**

---

## 🗂️ Tech Stack

- **Node.js**  
- **Express.js**  
- **jsonwebtoken** – Token-based authentication  
- **bcryptjs** – Password hashing  
- **Joi** – Schema validation  
- **Morgan** – HTTP request logger  
- **Dotenv** – Environment variable management  
- **Nodemon** – Auto-restart for development

## 📌 Notes
- Data is stored in-memory (products.js) for simplicity.

- You can easily replace the in-memory store with a real database like MongoDB or MySQL.

- Validation ensures users can only send valid data to the server.

- The JWT token expires in 1 hour. You will need to login again to get a new token.
